# HousingRegression

This repository is mainly a snapshot of an approach I take to cleaning datasets.

## Steps Taken

* Clean data by filling NaNs, categorizing, and encoding variables
* Run correlations to eliminate and isolate highly correlated variables
* Normalize variables
* Run ANOVA tests to determine variance
